# Related Projects

CERN Analysis Preservation is related to a couple of projects, some of which may come up in discussions and are therefore listed here:

.. glossary::

    `CAP <https://analysispreservation.cern.ch/>`_
    	An acronym for CERN Analysis Preservation. If you do not know what that is yet, take a look :doc:`here <../introduction>`.

    `COD/CODP <http://opendata.cern.ch/>`_
    	Acronyms for the CERN Open Data Portal. It is an open-access portal for CERN experiment data and software and serves as a learning platform as well as enabling further research and exploration.

    `DASPOS <http://daspos.org/>`_
    	An acronym for Data and Software Preservation for Open Science. A project to explore preservation possibilities and techniques in high energy physics.

    `DPHEP <https://www.dphep.org/>`_
    	An acronym for Data Preservation in High Energy Physics. A study group to explore preservation possibilities and techniques in high energy physics.

    `HEPData <https://www.hepdata.net/>`_
    	An open-access portal preserving and providing data, plots and tables from publications in high energy physics.

    `Invenio <http://inveniosoftware.org/>`_
    	An open source digital library framework developed at CERN that CERN Analysis Preservation is based on. It provides background functionality like authorization, working with analysis records and storage.

    `REANA <https://reana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    	An acronym for Reusable Analysis. A system that schedules and runs analyses on the CERN cloud based on :doc:`Kubernetes <../glossary>` and :doc:`Yadage Workflows <../glossary>`. It is used to rerun analyses from CERN Analysis Preservation and RECAST.

    `RECAST <http://recast.perimeterinstitute.ca/>`_
    	A service based on requests to re-execute an analysis chain with the possibility of using a new signal model. Analysis chains are defined and stored as JSON workflows on CERN Analysis Preservation and rerun using REANA. An analysis is wrapped inside a :doc:`Docker container <../glossary>`.
