## Deposit

A draft analysis decription on CERN Analysis Preservation.

## Docker/Docker Container

An open source software that allows arbitrary software to be wrapped inside a so called "Docker container". This container mimics the environment the software usually runs in. Thus, it can be preserved and run relatively easy.

## Invenio-Deposit

The part of the :doc:`Invenio <../related-projects>` framework that in case of CERN Analysis Preservation handles everything directly related to analysis records like permission to view and edit and storage.

## Kubernetes

An open source software used by :doc:`REANA <../related-projects>` for managing containers (usually Docker containers) on a cluster. This includes scheduling and scaling tasks and executing the software wrapped inside the containers.

## UMBRELLA

A container tool similar to Docker. It is designed as a light-weight tool for preserving an environment while considering hardware, operating system, software and data.

## Yadage Workflow

A set of JSON schemas with rules how to chain them together to describe analysis workflows. They are wrapped in a container (e.g. Docker) and can be executed by Yadage both locally (e.g. on your laptop) and distributed (e.g. on Kubernetes or :doc:`REANA <../related-projects>`).
